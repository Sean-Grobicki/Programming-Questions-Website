# Programming Questions Website
This project was a website which would allow users to answer programming questions with automatic feedback. The generating of the questions was done using an [external API](https://github.com/Sean-Grobicki/Programming-Questions-API) with the frontend here only used for some marking of questions and allowing for interaction with the user. This was designed with Next.js and using some React libraries for visually displaying the flowchart.
